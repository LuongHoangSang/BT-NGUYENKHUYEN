of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct

of your error message was never \def'ed. If you have
misspelled it (e.g., `\hobx'), type `I' and the correct
spelling (e.g., `I\hbox'). Otherwise just continue,
and I'll forget about whatever was undefined.
